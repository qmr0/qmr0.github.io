My name is Kamruddin Ahmed,

I have a passion for technology, data analysis, database design, reading and writing. So you might find posts related to these and more subjects.

I will write in English, Ich wurde gerne in Deutsche Schreiben.

<!-- ### Background -->

<!---
I've been exposed to computers and analysis since an early age, some may say, with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) back in 1991-1992, [Turbo Pascal 7.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal#Version_7.0) between 1999 and 2000, [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), and introduction to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) between 2000 and 2004, [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) between 2003 and 2004, [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) in 2005, [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) (mainly [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET), but also a brief period with [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation)) between 2005 and 2014, and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and its implementation [Jython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython) from 2015 to date.
